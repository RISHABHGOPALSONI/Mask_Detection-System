The present scenario of COVID-19 demands an efficient face mask detection application. The main goal of the project is to implement this system at entrances of colleges, airports, hospitals, and offices where chances of spread of COVID-19 through contagion are relatively higher. Reports indicate that wearing face masks while at work clearly reduces the risk of transmission. It is an object detection and classification problem with two different classes (Mask and Without Mask). A hybrid model using deep and classical machine learning for detecting face mask will be presented. A dataset is used to build this face mask detector using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow and Keras. While entering the place everyone should scan their face and then enter ensuring they have a mask with them. If anyone is found to be without a face mask, beep alert will be generated. As all the workplaces are opening. The numbers of cases of COVID-19 are still getting registered throughout the country. If everyone follows the safety measures, then it can come to an end. Hence to ensure that people wear masks while coming to work we hope this module will help in detecting it. Keywords â€“ Detection, Covid 19, mask, no mask, pandemic, safety.
